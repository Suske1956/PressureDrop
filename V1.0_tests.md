# Test SiPreDro  (Simple Pressure Drop)
June 04, 2021 - first test done - todo to be executed and . retest.
## ToDo list
1. ToDo - June 03, 2021 - enlarge text labels input group boxes
2. ToDo - June 03, 2021 - change tile main window and help about to SiPreDro  V 1.0.
3. ToDo - June 03, 2021 - split box output into boxes calculated values and output; Change title box input into input
values 
4. Done - June 04, 2021 - Entering 0.-1 in roughness or diameter causes the program to crash wit code: Process finished 
with exit code -1073740791. Internet did not give much result. Debugging program: class CheckInput gives back None in 
case of value error. This causes the line _if self.calc.roughness >= self.calc.diameter_ to crash since you can evaluate 
numbers only. Fix: _self.value_float = None_ ==> _self.value_float = 0_. This did not work. The line _return 
self.value_float_ had an indent error. It should return always. Not only in case of a correct conversion. class 
CheckInput is modified accordingly. 
5. ToDo - June 04, 2021 - using the radio buttons in liquid- and flow data does not affect the input values. 
6. ToDo - June 04, 2021 - a density with a value 0 leads to a division by zero in Calculate.prerequisites(). Since 
Calculate should be a robust class the error handling must be within the class. This goes for all division within class 
Calculate. 
7. ToDo - June 04, 2021 - Input of negative values should not be possible 
## General layout errors
- Liquid data: text is too long for the label ==> generate more space
- Title main Window and help about is not yet according to name program
- For the groupbox output it is beneficial to have two columns one for calculation values and 
one for output. In output: pressure drop in Pa, bar and m liquid height. In future also number of fittings and pressure 
drop caused by line, fittings and total.
## Pipe line data
- Values export correct to the box input values. -ok
- Diameter vs roughness is ok: in case roughness is larger than diameter ==> error handling ok?
- Input strange values: see todo 4 - ok after fix
- negative values are possible. - see todo 7
## Liquid data
- Values export correct to the box input values - ok
- Use of radia buttons - see todo 5 
- Input strange values. - see todo 6
## Flow data
- Values export correct to the box input values - ok
- Use of radia buttons - see todo 5 
- Input strange values. - see todo 6
