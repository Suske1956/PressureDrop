# Test SiPreDroCal  (Simple Pressure Drop Calculator)
June 04, 2021 - first test done - todo to be executed and . retest.
## ToDo list
1. Done - June 06, 2021 - enlarge text labels input group boxes
2. Done - June 06, 2021 - change tile main window and help about to SiPreDroCal  V-1.0.
3. Done - June 06, 2021 - split box output into boxes calculated values and output; Change title box input into input
values  
3.1 PresDr.py is regenerated with changes todo 1 through 3. The ui tested briefly. Thorough testing see todo 8. 
PresDr.py is committed and pushed to be tested in a Windows environment.  
3.2 Done - June 06, 2021 - Calculate pressure drop in bar and present in output box
4. Done - June 04, 2021 - Entering 0.-1 in roughness or diameter causes the program to crash wit code: Process finished 
with exit code -1073740791. Internet did not give much result. Debugging program: class CheckInput gives back None in 
case of value error. This causes the line _if self.calc.roughness >= self.calc.diameter_ to crash since you can evaluate 
numbers only. Fix: _self.value_float = None_ ==> _self.value_float = 0_. This did not work. The line _return 
self.value_float_ had an indent error. It should return always. Not only in case of a correct conversion. class 
CheckInput is modified accordingly. 
5. Done - June 07, 2021 - using the radio buttons in liquid- and flow data does not affect the input values. The program 
   runs from radio button selected to either viscosity_known() or flow_or_velocity_known(). The line edit fields set 
   active or inactive and an argument in Calculate is set: dynamic_viscosity_active or velocity_active. The method after 
   editing the line edit not called. Added this call to solve the problem. Now the line edit gives an error since the 
   value is None. To be solved in todo 7. Additionally the focus is set to the appropriate line edit after using the 
   radio buttons 
6. Done - June 06, 2021 - a density with a value 0 leads to a division by zero in Calculate.prerequisites(). Since 
Calculate should be a robust class the error handling must be within the class. This goes for all division within class 
Calculate.  
6.1 June 6, 2021 - Calculate modified - In all cases where a division is in the formula introduced; a condition > 0;
tested briefly: the calculation still runs.
7. Done - June 07, 2021 - Input of negative values is illogical and, thus, should be impossible. Since class Calculate 
is robust it is logical to deal with this aspect in class CheckInput. The class must give a message in case of an error
which tells the user what is wrong. In case the value af the line edit is None the red background should not be shown.  
   7.1 Modifications class CheckInput: In case of an input error the value 0 is returned. This value does not give 
   issues in calculate and is better than doing nothing and keeping the old value. Default value for background color is
   white. additional method added to CheckInput - message.  
8. Done - June 07, 2021 - rerun all tests below
## General layout errors
- Liquid data: text is too long for the label ==> generate more space
- Title main Window and help about is not yet according to name program
- For the groupbox output it is beneficial to have two columns one for calculation values and 
one for output. In output: pressure drop in Pa, bar and m liquid height. In future also number of fittings and pressure 
drop caused by line, fittings and total.
## Pipe line data
- Values export correct to the box input values. -ok
- Diameter vs roughness is ok: in case roughness is larger than diameter ==> error handling ok?
- Input strange values: see todo 4 - ok after fix
- negative values are possible. - see todo 7
## Liquid data
- Values export correct to the box input values - ok
- Use of radia buttons - see todo 5 
- Input strange values. - see todo 6
## Flow data
- Values export correct to the box input values - ok
- Use of radia buttons - see todo 5 
- Input strange values. - see todo 6
