# SiPreDro version 1.1
In this version the pressure drop in a line with fittings can be calculated. To make this possible several changes
are required:
- A data file to store properties of fittings
  - Property data can be modified and complemented by the user
  - Property data are stored in a file on the local drive
  - A reset of the property data to a standard set of fittings is possible
  - Consider exporting and importing a datafile.  
- Extend the program to be able to calculate the pressure drop in a combination of fittings and a line. 
- A change in layout of the user interface. presenting everything on one screen is not possible anymore.

Once the fitting data are in place introduction of some standard fluid data is to be considered.   
To facilitate development branches for each addition will be used 
## Data storage
### Database
Branch: v1.1.01 database first issue  
Status: Next branch  
The data will be stored in a SQLite database starting point is the shopping list, but now for fittings. We start with 
code to generate the database and introduce some fittings. In fact this can be the reset function. Next we need code to
change the data: add fittings, change values. In contrast to the shopping list everything is supported by gui screens. 
### Use data in the main program
Branch: tbd  
Status: not started  
The data must be available in the main calculation 
## Extend the calculation
### Reconsider the current objects
Branch: v1.1.02 reconsider code  
Status: Next branch  
Consider readability of the code and maintainability. Also reconsider naming of the (python) files to comply with naming conventions and have a clear set of
names. This can be in parallel with the database development. First objective is to document possible improvements and not yet implement them. Implementation 
to be combined with extension of the calculations
### Implement the extension of the calculations
Branch: tbd  
Status: not started  
Fittings can be included in the calculation.  
This can be done using some dummy data in order to separate this process from the database development. 
## Change layout
Branch: tbd  
Status: not started  
The change in layout can be in parallel to other steps. To be considered: split layout change into some separate 
branches which can be merged one by one to the development branch.  
The use of menus seems obvious, since this gives the best control.
