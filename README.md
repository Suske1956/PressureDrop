# SiPreDroCal  (Simple Pressure Drop Calculator)
Version 1.0 June 7th, 2021

Simple Pressure drop calculator programmed in Python  
License: GNU General Public License v3.0

Versions for programming an testing:  
Python: version 3.7.3  
Qt:     version 5.11.3

Python scripts: PresDr.py, and PresDrControl.py should be copied to a directory.  
Obviously Python is a requirement. On Mac and Linux it is usually preinstalled  
Make sure sys, math, pyqt5, and scipy are installed. Installation procedure depends 
on your platform.  
Start from cli with: python PresDrControl.py 

The current version is very basic and presents values in SI units and scientific notation.  
In future version I want to add additional output, and the possibility to include fittings. 

I appreciate any suggestion.
