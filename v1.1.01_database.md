# v1.1.01 temporary notes
Temporary file belonging to branch v1.1.01 - database first issue  
These notes will be transferred tot the documentation of the python files  
We need a SQLite database end a gui to communicate with the database.  
## Database
For the time being there is one database named pres_drop.db  
The controls are in pres_drop.py
### database log
#### November 2, 2021
The shopping list is the basis for the design. Today I cloned the project to the local drive. A quick look at the files 
learned that 50% of the information is the command line interface menu. the rest is about using the database.  
generated pres_drop_db.py

### Database design
table: fittings   
fields:
- index
- name fitting
- friction factor
- remarks
- ?? user generated - to be decided.
## Gui
Name of the gui: pd_database.ui and pd_database.py  
name of the control file: pd_database_control.py  
Functions:
- Refresh - start with an entirely new database
- list - consider presenting the list always on the database screen
- modify data
- add data
- delete data
### pd_database.ui and pd_database.py

### pd_database_control.py
This module will inherit both pres_drop_db.py and pd_database.py. It controls the database using functions from 
pres_drop_db.py and communicates with the client through the user interface.
