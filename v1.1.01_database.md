# v1.1.01 temporary notes
Temporary file belonging to branch v1.1.01 - database first issue  
These notes will be transferred tot the documentation of the python files  
We need a SQLite database end a gui to communicate with the database.
## To do:
- Nov 08, 2021 - Transform pres_drop_db.py into a universal script to deal with a sqlite database. this involves 
  restructuring all the constants. Basically the SQLite command is to be split into the actual command and variables. 
  Probably string formatting is required for this purpose. For the time being I stick to the constants in the module
- Consider showing the overview of fittings in a table and not in a list. 
- reconsider all names involved in this branch
- make sure all relevant information is inherited in the notes belonging to the python files: pd_database_control.py
- archive the temp files for later use as required.
## Database
For the time being there is one database named pres_drop.db  
The controls are in pres_drop.py. Consider making a standard database script for more python projects. Thus, variables 
for database name field list etc. 
### database log
#### November 2, 2021
The shopping list is the basis for the design. Today I cloned the project to the local drive. A quick look at the files 
learned that 50% of the information is the command line interface menu. the rest is about using the database.  
generated pres_drop_db.py
#### November 3, 2021
I had a closer look to the shopping list. at this point we can keep things much simpler since our database contains 
only one table. Functions we need are: 
- Create database 
- Create table
- Populate table with generic data
- List data
- Add record
- Change record
- Delete record

Today started with list database the method sqlite3.connect(<dbname>) initiated the database. Added pres_drop_db to 
.gitignore and added .gitignore to git since pushing .gitignore is common in the coders world. 
todos remain  
No push today
#### November 04, 2021
In pres_drop_db.py a class DB operations is generated. I finished the function list_tables() which was also present in 
the shopping list. Removed all communication with console and introduced a return statement. Started with 
refresh_database(). Found that dropping database is impossible in sqlite3. so this function removes all tables and 
repopulates the database with default content. Currently, just one table: fittings.  
Pushed the directory - "update Nov 04, 2021"  
note: there is a typo in the name of the python script. Change that after this commit
#### November 06, 2021
copied pred_drop_db.py to pres_drop_db.py and deleted the first file. 
added functions refresh database, list fittings and add record. 
todo items exist --> no push today
#### November 07, 2021
added function fittings_remove to delete a record by rowid
completed all documentation in pres_drop_db.py and committed including this markdown file
### Database design
table: fittings   
fields:
- row index
- fitting_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
- fitting_friction_factor REAL NOT NULL
- fitting_notes TEXT
## Gui
naming of the gui: pd_database.ui, pd_database.py and pd_database_control.py  
- pd_database.ui = qt designer generated xml file.
- pd_database.py =  pyuic5 generated python script.
- pd_database_control.py = controls for the user interface, with documentation.   
Functions:
- Refresh - start with an entirely new database
- list: the list is presented on the database screen in a list widget
- modify record - pushbutton
- add record - pushbutton
- delete record - pushbutton
### pd_database.ui and pd_database.py

### pd_database_control.py
This module will inherit both pres_drop_db.py and pd_database.py. It controls the database using functions from 
pres_drop_db.py and communicates with the client through the user interface. 
### Gui log
#### November 08, 2021
Generated files required to manage the database via a gui resulting in an empty widget with a control script: 
pd_database_control.py. First thing to do is opening the widget from a main window. I did this before but opening 
of widgets became obsolete since I started using the Qt messagebox. Now we really need a widget since we want to show a 
list of fittings and modify this list from the widget. The files, required, will not be in git. so I need a commit and 
push today with the current status: "files for introduced"  
temporary files: temp_main.ui and temp_main.py - open pd_database.ui
First I need to read some stuff then continue. 
#### November 09, 2021
Found YouTuber, Jie Jenn, who posted over 100 YouTube films regarding PyQT5. Today I read about the combo box which 
will be required anyway. created temp_main_window.ui and temp_combo.py for testing. Obviously both are not staged. 
#### November 10, 2021
Currently, I am stuck in creating an action opening a widget. I did not find a YouTube video showing a decent howto. 
Also, a previous course did not bring me a quick result. Today I started reading a tutorial I found at "tutorials point"
It looks like I need the Qdialog class. The tutorial does not give me enough clues to go on, but I can start searching.
I found this site: https://www.pythonguis.com/ with a lot of, very well-structured info. Info about dialogs can be 
found here: https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-dialogs-qt-designer/
Decided that it is useful to follow the entire tutorial. I will record the learnings temporary to this md file and 
transfer relevant information to my notes file later on. Start with the first part of the tutorial: 
https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/first-steps-qt-creator/. We start with a main window. The main window comes with 
a central widget, a menu bar and a status bar. Next we drop a label and a push button on the main window. They become a 
child of the central widget. Right-clicking on the main menu show lay-out options amongst others. The tutorial uses 
lay-out horizontally which places the button and the label side by side.  
Loading the ui file in python is possible without converting the code see temp_load_main_window.py.  
Alternatively, the ui file can be converted to python using pyuic5:  
pyuic5 -x temp_main_window.ui -o temp_main_window.py resulting in temp_main_window.py. Implementing the control file: 
temp_main_window_control.py opens the tweaking options for the user interface.  
uic will add all child widgets to the interface. everything else before was a repetition of previous learnings.
#### November 11, 2021
Today I read a lot of the tutorial stuff and came to the point where firing a dialog comes within reach.  
First I added "temp*" to .gitignore in order to avoid adding temp files to git. .gitignore is committed   
temp_main_window.py and temp_dialog1.py were generated from the .ui file using pyuic5. temp_main_window_control.py was 
already generated. The main window contains just one push button: "show dialog". By loading dialog 1 into the main 
window control a class for the dialog can be generated which allows the main window to start the dialog. In fact the 
"control" is the application. which will contain classes for the gui and classes doing the work like calculating and 
storing or retrieving data. This awareness gives clues to restructuring the whole set of python files.  
I did not explore loading a dialog with the use of uic (directly load from the xml file) This is not convenient for me. 
Next I have to get information from the dialog to the pd_database_control.py and change records via pres_drop_db.py.
#### November 12, 2021
Today I played a with pres_drop_db.py in order to import it in pd_database_control.py. Basically there is no issue. The 
test commands in press_drop_db.py are moved into a docstring avoiding calls from the imported module. Later on the 
constants part is te be rewritten. see todo in this file. Today I commit this markdown file and pres_drop_db.py. Also 
push to GitHub. tomorrow I want to add a combo box to the user interface and use it to do something with the database. 
Also get a list of fittings from the database. 
#### November 13, 2021
Today looking how I can get the list of fittings in the user interface. In Qt5 designer I found a list widget and a 
table widget. I added both to pd_database.ui resulting in empty white squares. My search, how to populate and use them 
can start now. I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hbL0ztIYCg resulting in temp_list_widget.py. This 
results in a pop-up widget with item returning something after double-clicking. Next I have to get this working within 
a form. 
#### November 14, 2021
Apparently I forgot how to decouple a Qt designer generated python code with you own code. A class which starts the 
user interface is required. In this class the buttons, lists etc. are coupled to the code. I got the list widget 
working, also with temp_list_widget.py as an example. The rest of today's time I spend on getting information about the 
table widget. In temp_table_widget.py I coded an example derived from YouTube.
#### November 15, 2021
Got the table widget from YouTube working. The table widget in pyqt5 is a kind of Excel sheet. It is quit versatile and 
may be of use later. For my purpose the list widget is enough to work with. Tomorrow I will start making a database gui
with the functionality of the cli I made before. This involves making a plan, modifying pd_database.ui and modifying
pd_database_control.py as required. 
#### November 16, 2021
Changed the layout of the pd-database gui. as the objective of this branch is obtaining a stand-alone module to be 
integrated later I did not focus on style but functionality only. Got the close button working. Modified the data, 
listed, to show more information. For convenience, we need a box, showing one record, which performs the tasks 
affecting one record: modify, delete and add. This will involve a change of the main window. The sub window should be 
modal. No reason to commit anything yet.
#### November 17, 2021
Finished a pop-up pd-record with the data of one fitting on the screen. The control is to be implemented into 
pd_database_control. So, I will import it there and make a class launching it. Question to answer is whether the window 
is part of a function which returns the data and lets the main program update the database, or can access the database 
itself for an update. I will start with the show_item function. Currently, output to the console is generated. Objective 
is: function reads data for the current record; a function, showing the data in pd_record.py, is called. First I will 
add a button to the main screen replacing the double-clicked call. Then we need a function to list the database and 
(re)populate the list window (after a change of data). Typing this I come to the conclusion that it is better to let 
the functions belonging to the buttons change the database. Made a separate class fort database operations. I will make 
a class for the pd_record window next. Found that it is possible to convert a tuple into a string. This is used in the 
function list_records. First renaming is required: pd_record ==> pd_database_record (for tomorrow). next deal with 
transforming the QListView to QTableView. 
#### November 18, 2021
Found that in case "noEditTriggers" is activated the table cannot be edited. 
In "QTable Widget" row- and column count can be set. 
It is worth inspecting QTableView. Found a YouTube explaining how to get a pandas dataframe into a TableView. see: 
temp_table_view_fromYouTube. It uses QAbstractTableModel to populate the table. How is not exactly explained. so, 
I have to check the QAbstractTableModel documentation. This YouTube looks promising: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL2NdSubiNY I will use this information in pd_database --> work for tomorrow. 
#### November 19, 2021
Rename pd_record --> pd_database_record old files removed from git.
Change pd_database.ui:
- morphed QListView: list_fittings into QTableWidget: table_fittings
- editTriggers --> noEditTriggers
- Added 3 columns: ID, Name and Friction factor
- changed width of the form to 750px and set min with also to 750px ==> always show table correct.
- verticalHeaderVisible = False  

Changed pd_database_control.py  
- modified list_records() ==> output is list of tuples, in case of SQLite error no output.
- method start_form() is renamed to refresh_form() since this method will be called after each modification of the 
database
- method refresh_form() is updated:
  - set column width's (can be adjusted as required in a later stage)
  - set row count to length of the database
  - populate fields in the table
  - move connections to module \_\_init__()  

commit and push of all files
