# v1.1.01 temporary notes
Temporary file belonging to branch v1.1.01 - database first issue  
These notes will be transferred tot the documentation of the python files  
We need a SQLite database end a gui to communicate with the database.
## To do:
- Nov 08, 2021 - Transform pres_drop_db.py into an universal script to deal with a sqlite database.
- reconsider all names involved in this branch
- make sure all relevant information is inherited in the notes belonging to the python files
## Database
For the time being there is one database named pres_drop.db  
The controls are in pres_drop.py. Consider making a standard database script for more python projects. Thus, variables 
for database name field list etc. 
### database log
#### November 2, 2021
The shopping list is the basis for the design. Today I cloned the project to the local drive. A quick look at the files 
learned that 50% of the information is the command line interface menu. the rest is about using the database.  
generated pres_drop_db.py
#### November 3, 2021
I had a closer look to the shopping list. at this point we can keep things much simpler since our database contains 
only one table. Functions we need are: 
- Create database 
- Create table
- Populate table with generic data
- List data
- Add record
- Change record
- Delete record

Today started with list database the method sqlite3.connect(<dbname>) initiated the database. Added pres_drop_db to 
.gitignore and added .gitignore to git since pushing .gitignore is common in the coders world. 
todos remain  
No push today
#### November 04, 2021
In pres_drop_db.py a class DB operations is generated. I finished the function list_tables() which was also present in 
the shopping list. Removed all communication with console and introduced a return statement. Started with 
refresh_database(). Found that dropping database is impossible in sqlite3. so this function removes all tables and 
repopulates the database with default content. Currently, just one table: fittings.  
Pushed the directory - "update Nov 04, 2021"  
note: there is a typo in the name of the python script. Change that after this commit
#### November 06, 2021
copied pred_drop_db.py to pres_drop_db.py and deleted the first file. 
added functions refresh database, list fittings and add record. 
todo items exist --> no push today
#### November 07, 2021
added function fittings_remove to delete a record by rowid
completed all documentation in pres_drop_db.py and committed including this markdown file
### Database design
table: fittings   
fields:
- row index
- fitting_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
- fitting_friction_factor REAL NOT NULL
- fitting_notes TEXT
## Gui
naming of the gui: pd_database.ui, pd_database.py and pd_database_control.py  
- pd_database.ui = qt designer generated xml file.
- pd_database.py =  pyuic5 generated python script.
- pd_database_control.py = controls for the user interface, with documentation.   
Functions:
- Refresh - start with an entirely new database
- list - consider presenting the list always on the database screen
- modify data
- add data
- delete data
### pd_database.ui and pd_database.py

### pd_database_control.py
This module will inherit both pres_drop_db.py and pd_database.py. It controls the database using functions from 
pres_drop_db.py and communicates with the client through the user interface. 
### Gui log
#### November 08, 2021
Generated files required to manage the database via a gui resulting in an empty widget with a control script: 
pd_database_control.py. First thing to do is opening the widget from a main window. I did this before but opening 
of widgets became obsolete since I started using the Qt messagebox. Now we really need a widget since we want to show a 
list of fittings and modify this list from the widget. The files, required, will not be in git. so I need a commit 
today with the current status: "files for introduced"
